# EmployeeFactory
EmployeeFactory is a group project by the 'udonUnit' consisting of Imogen, Irina, Alexander and Mamoon ðŸ‘‹.

The project aims to create a Java application that utilises a provided EmployeeFactory to generate random employee data,
converts the data from the provided csv file into Employee objects using a DTO class, stores them, and implements 
methods to search for employees by Emp ID, Last Name (partial match), hire date range, and age range.

# More about the project

Our application allows the user to interrogate the data to : identify an employee based on the employee Id number and
by partially inputting the Last Name of an employee. Additionally, it is possible to query the data and retrieve all 
employees hired within a specified date range. Lastly, the user is able to search for all the employees within a specified
age range.

We hope to extend the functionality of our queries by adding methods to query our public record that enable us to retrieve an employee
by an email address, gender or a salary range for example.

To enhance maintainability we created logging functionality using java.util.logging. Our colour-coded logger allows you to easily track 
the flow of the program, record the state when an important event happens and capture errors or exceptions that occur during runtime.
